            <h3> I am an Idaho native living in California and dreaming of my childhood spent living on a sailboat in the Bahamas. I enjoy exploring the wilderness, sailing to remote locations, and scanning shelves of used bookstores. As a creator, I see the world and apply my knowledge through an artistic lens and harbor a fascination with the profound impact of design within the realm of aesthetics. <br><br> My passion for design burst through the doorway the fall of 2014 during my first couple months of attending California Polytechnic University as a Studio Art Major. After entering into a higher education environment, I saw more opportunities appear over the horizon and I decided to shift my concentration slightly within Art and Design. <br> <br>
            Currently, as a 2nd year Graphic Design Major, I'm extremely eager to continue expanding and refining my skills through my education and any project I can get my hands on.<br> <br>

               <i>Design can be art.
               Design can be aesthetics.
               Design is so simple, that’s why it is so complicated.</i>
